<!-- TODO:

    Questions to be ckecked with supervisor:

    INSTALLATIONS GUIDE!

        -naming conventions: should I call an item in an array name-name or nameName ? for consistency... (see 'pblsh-date' in $articles array)

        -authors array: Should I include the ID to be displayed on the webpage?
                        Is there a way of creating an ID and fetching the author name by checking for matching ID between the two arrays?

        -make sure my .editorconfig and readme-files are approved

        -type declarations for compare function can't be used!

        -should I put the usort() function in functions.php?
        -should I declare types within my functions too? Look at functions.. like the compare function for instance.
        (add those blocks with @param before functions)
        -add descriptions in comments of what my code does

        -which functions should go in functions.php file?

        -ask about how things are supposed to be divided - (header.php, index.php, footer.php - where do types declarations go, where do I require functions.php)

        -indentation in index.php (and header.php and footer.php)

        -are docblocks mandatory?

        -->


### Project structure:

- index.php - my main file where I will basically 'link'/require all other files; to be run in browser; will basically contain the structure 'require data.php, require header.php, require posts.php, require footer.php'

- data.php - file containing array with data concerning articles
  - txt files - files containing text content of articles (to be linked to data.php)
  - img folder - folder containing images for articles (also to be 'linked' in data.php)



- posts.php - file containing foreach loop looping through articles and some html tags to structure content for each post (will be 'required' in index.php)

- header.php - Header for index.php, including html markup for nav bar

- footer.php - Footer for index.php

- functions.php - Contains getAuthor, compare, and getPblshDate functions

- content: Folder containing txt files with text content for each article
