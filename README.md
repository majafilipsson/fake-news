### Project structure:

- `index.php` - my main file where I will basically 'link'/require all other files; will basically contain the structure 'require data.php, require functions.php, require header.php, require articles.php, require footer.php'

- `data.php` - file containing arrays with data concerning articles
  - txt files - files containing text content of articles (to be linked to in data.php) (to be found in folder 'content')
  - img folder - folder containing images for project (could be tied to data.php in the future)


- `articles.php` - file containing foreach loop looping through articles and some html tags to structure content for each post

- `header.php` - Header for index.php, including html markup for nav bar

- `footer.php` - Footer for index.php

- `functions.php` - contains getAuthor, compare, and getPblshDate functions
