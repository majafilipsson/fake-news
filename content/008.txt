"Yes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so serious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible trap for her."
<br>
<br>
"Well, it is a possible supposition."
<br>
<br>
"You think so, too?"
<br>
<br>
"I did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon this as likely?"
<br>
<br>
"I do not think Flora would hurt a fly."
<br>
<br>
"Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray what is your own theory as to what took place?"
<br>
<br>
"Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I have given you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair, the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife."
<br>
<br>
"In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?"
<br>
<br>
"Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back--I will not say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to without success--I can hardly explain it in any other fashion."
<br>
<br>
"Well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis," said Holmes, smiling. "And now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have nearly all my data. May I ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table so that you could see out of the window?"
<br>
<br>
"We could see the other side of the road and the Park."
<br>
<br>
"Quite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer. I shall communicate with you."
<br>
<br>
"Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem," said our client, rising.
<br>
<br>
"I have solved it."
<br>
<br>
"Eh? What was that?"
<br>
<br>
"I say that I have solved it."
<br>
<br>
"Where, then, is my wife?"
<br>
<br>
"That is a detail which I shall speedily supply."
<br>
<br>
Lord St. Simon shook his head. "I am afraid that it will take wiser heads than yours or mine," he remarked, and bowing in a stately, old-fashioned manner he departed.
<br>
<br>
"It is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my head by putting it on a level with his own," said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. "I think that I shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this cross-questioning. I had formed my conclusions as to the case before our client came into the room."
<br>
<br>
"My dear Holmes!"
<br>
<br>
"I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I remarked before, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination served to turn my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial evidence is occasionally very convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to quote Thoreau's example."
<br>
<br>
"But I have heard all that you have heard."
<br>
<br>
"Without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me so well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back, and something on very much the same lines at Munich the year after the Franco-Prussian War. It is one of these cases--but, hullo, here is Lestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade! You will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and there are cigars in the box."
<br>
<br>
The official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas bag in his hand. With a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him.
<br>
<br>
"What's up, then?" asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. "You look dissatisfied."
<br>
<br>
"And I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case. I can make neither head nor tail of the business."
<br>
<br>
"Really! You surprise me."
<br>
<br>
"Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip through my fingers. I have been at work upon it all day."
