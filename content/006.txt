The unknown gentleman who had enticed the dog to the door of his luxurious first floor flat rang the bell, and the dog immediately raised his eyes to the large black card with gold lettering hanging to one side of the wide door panelled with rosy, ribbed glass. The first three letters he made out straightaway: "P-r-o â€” Pro". But after that came a paunchy two-sided trashy sort of a letter which might mean anything: surely not "Pro-letariat"? thought Sharik with surprise...
<br>
<br>
"Impossible!" He raised his nose, took another sniff at the fur coat and thought with conviction: No, not so much as a whiff of the proletariat. A learned word and God knows what it means.
<br>
<br>
Unexpectedly, a cheerful light came on behind the pink glass, showing up the  black card even more vividly. The door opened without a sound and a pretty young woman in a white apron and a lace cap materialised before the dog and his master. The former was conscious of a divine wave of warmth and from the woman's skirt there wafted a scent like lily-of-the -valley.
<br>
<br>
This is life, thought the dog, I really fancy this.
<br>
<br>
"Do us the honour, Mister Sharik," the gentleman ironically ushered him over the threshold, and Sharik reverently did him the honour, wagging his tail.
<br>
<br>
The rich entrance hall was foil of things. A full-length mirror impressed itself on the dog's memory with an immediate reflection of a second shaggy, ragged Sharik. There were a terrifying pair of antlers high up on the wall, endless for coats and galoshes and an opalescent tulip with electricity hanging from the ceiling.
<br>
<br>
"Where did you find such a creature, Philip Philipovich?" asked the woman, smiling and helping him take off the heavy coat with its silver-fox lining. "Good heavens! He's covered in mange!"
<br>
<br>
"Nonsense. Where do you see mange?" demanded the gentleman with abrupt severity.
<br>
<br>
Having taken off his coat he turned out to be dressed in a black suit of English cloth and a golden chain glinted joyfully but not too brightly across his stomach.
<br>
<br>
"Wait now, don't wiggle, phew... don't wiggle, stupid. Hm!.. That's not mange... stand still, you devil!.. Hm! Aha. It's a burn. What villain scalded you, eh? Stand still, will you?.."
<br>
<br>
"That jail-bird of a chef, the chef!" the dog pronounced with pathetic eyes and whimpered.
<br>
<br>
"Zina," the gentleman ordered. "Into the consulting room with him this instant and bring me my smock."
<br>
<br>
The woman whistled and snapped her fingers and, after a moment's doubt, the dog followed her. Together they proceeded along a narrow, dimly-lit corridor, passed one varnished door, went on to the end and then turned left into a dark cupboard of a room to which the dog took an instant dislike because of the ominous smell. The darkness clicked and was transformed into blinding day; sparkling, shining white lights beaming in at him from every side.
<br>
<br>
Oh no, you don't, the dog howled inwardly. Thanks very much, but I'm not putting up with this. Now I understand, may the devil take you and your salami. You've brought me to a dog's hospital and now you'll pour castor oil down me and chop up that flank of mine which is too sore to be touched with your knives!
<br>
<br>
"Hey, where are you off to?" cried the woman called Zina.
